              PROPS is intended to celebrate the outstanding contributions of the Full Sail learning community. As part of our culture, PROPS will be utilized on a              daily basis to recognize members of the education team who best represent the principles of:

           <p>Annually, each school (Audio Arts, Business Schools, Design and Technology Schools, Liberal Studies, Communications and Visual 			               Arts) will host an event where awards will be given in the above categories based upon recognitions contributed throughout the year.               Recognitions can be placed by students, peers, supervisors, and/or members of the Full Sail family. These recognitions will be reviewed by a PROPS               committee and will be awarded PROPS points based on a predetermined scale. (Scale TBD).</p>
           <p>Whenever recognized, individuals will receive an official PROPS letter with details of their recognition.  This letter will also be         	               forwarded to the nominee’s supervisor(s) and a copy will be kept in their official personnel record. The PROPS points will be documented through the    		               Faculty Affairs and Development department. Faculty Affairs and Development will be responsible for maintaining the database, sending monthly               notifications to each PROPS recipient, and communication of recognitions to the learning community. (Eventually this process will become digital               through the Faculty Development website).
           </p>
        	<p>Each year, the PROPS committee, along with the Directors of Education, will review the PROPS points leaders within their degrees to 	               			              identify award recipients based on the PROPS points received. The criteria, awards and descriptions are listed below:
